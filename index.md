<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> <b> About Me: </b> </h2>

A diligent 4th year student, currently studying BSc (Hons) Computer Game Applications Development at Abertay University. Always looking for new opportunities to broaden my knowledge and expand my abilities. Eager to take on different challenges and solve any problem that may arise to produce outstanding results.

My technical skills include programming languages such as C++ and C#, as well as experience using both Unity and the Unreal engine. Additionally, shaders, graphics, gameplay and tools programming are also skills that I acquired both from my course and individual research.

<h3 style="color:Black;"> Procedurally Generated, Environmentally Responsive Trees, in Real-Time. </h3>
As my honours project, I chose to explore the possibility of adding evolving trees that are also affected by their surrounding environment, in commercial games. Two algorithms were compared for their suitability for the task, using quantitative and qualitative measures. Both achieved a low performance effect and high visual appeal, making the choice of algorithm a stylistic one.
