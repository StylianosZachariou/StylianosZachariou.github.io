A diligent 3rd year student, currently studying BSc (Hons) Computer Game Applications Development at Abertay University. Always looking for new opportunities to broaden my knowledge and expand my abilities. Eager to take on different challenges and solve any problem that may arise to produce outstanding results.

My technical skills include programming languages such as C++ and C#, as well as experience using both Unity and the Unreal engine. Additionally, shaders, graphics, gameplay and tools programming are also skills that I acquired both from my course and individual research.
